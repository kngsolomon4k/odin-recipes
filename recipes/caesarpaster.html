    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>This Caesar pasta has all the flavors of a traditional Caesar salad—fragrant garlic, the umami of anchovies (using Worcestershire sauce as a stand-in), salty Parmesan cheese, and the crunch of a crisp crouton—but it is in a lovely angel hair side dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <strong>Lemony Breadcrumbs</strong>
    <Ul>
       <li>1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
       <li>1/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
       <Li>1 cup chopped flat leaf parsley</li>
       <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
</Ul>
<strong>Paster</strong>
<ul>
    <li>8 ounces angel hair pasta</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon finely grated or minced garlic</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
    <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
    <p></p><li>For breadcrumbs, combine oil, butter and bread crumbs in a skillet. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until toasted and golden brown, about 3 minutes. Add parsley and lemon zest; season with salt. Cook, stirring, until very fragrant of citrus, about 15 seconds. Transfer crumbs to a small bowl and set aside.</li>
    <p></p><li>For pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add angel hair and cook, stirring frequently during the first 30 seconds, until tender with a bite, about 3 minutes total.</li>
    <p></p><li>Meanwhile, combine olive oil, garlic, and pepper in a skillet. Cook over medium heat just until garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute. Once pasta has cooked for about 3 minutes, scoop out 1/2 cup pasta water; add to skillet. Stir in mustard and Worcestershire sauce. </li>
    <p></p><li>Turn up heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly to emulsify the water with oil, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low. Using tongs, transfer pasta to the skillet. Alternately, reserve 1 cup pasta water, drain pasta thoroughly, then add pasta to skillet.</li>
    <p></p><li>Return heat to high; cook and stir pasta until completely coated and saucs is creamy. Add more pasta water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time if needed. Remove the pasta from the heat and add Parmesan; toss to coat.</li>
    <p></p><li>Divide between serving bowls and top with breadcrumbs.</li>
</ol>
